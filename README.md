# About Me

So, it's been a long time since I really coded, and I was still young the first time I coded even someting! But now; I'm reentering my old era of young developper to become one, **a real one**. I want that to make it my profession, because I always loved computers, and all that stuff.

I'm still new, (or new-new) since i'm relearning basic thing through online tutorial on YouTube or even with AI! Maybe I will talk more about my perceptions of AI? What do you think?

And before I continue speaking about me, I'm not an native english speaker, I might do some grammatical errors :D.

- Iâ€™m currently working on different little projects without any time pressure.

- How to reach me? UUuuuh for now idk, so please wait.

- Iâ€™m currently RE-learning (or I will learn) : Javascript (and all the web stuff; HTML, CSS, PHP. . .) / Java! I'm exited to learn this programming language!

- I play mobile games, not a pro but a good player. Brawl Stars, Clash Royale (but only recently cuz I stopped like 2023 or end-2022), Subway Surfers and that's all?

- So I speak french (natively), english (since primary school I always whatched english videos) and that's it for now.
